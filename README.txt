// ** urly-player ** - A minimal video-browser for looping clean feed YouTube VIDEO_ID's.

This simple HTML file creates a responsive and borderless video player that hides all UI elements and loops the YouTube video specified. Perfect for late night sessions if your'e working in a multi-window environment. //


// **Instructions**

1. Open the "urly-player_TEMPLATE.html" file using a text or code editor. 
2. Replace the current 'YOUR_VIDEO_ID' in the JavaScript section with the actual video ID from the YouTube URL you want to use. For example, if the URL is <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
3. Save your updated HTML file, open it in a web browser, and you should see the video playing in loop, fullscreen, and without any UI elements. 
4. Enjoy your new disctraction-free video browser.


Notes: urly-player was built and tested in a macOS environment with Safari but should work fine in any other OS and browser as its a HTML file (for now).
